Encryption and Hashing:
Encryption: Scrambling a message, and then using a key to decode it
Hashing: Can read going forward, but almost impossible to read backwards. Deals with prime numbers and what not

Hashing and Salting:
Salting is generating a randome set of characters to add to the end of a password
Salt rounds basically rinse and repeat. This means that you would take the hash, and then salt it, and then hash it again
