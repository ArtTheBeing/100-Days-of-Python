FONTS MATTER

Serif family has feet at bottom. text with edges.

Sans-Serif have perfect right angles. No feet. Humanist typeface in sans-serif is popular among startups. Humanist is highly readable and highly legible

Alignment is very important. Make sure items are alligned as it makes the website look more organized and professional. Target your audience well.
Use contrasting color schemes for pop, and similar colors for smoothness.

Hierarchy is another huge deal. Using popping colors and bigger sizes for fonts, you can create a hierarchy for what is seen first vs what is seen last.

Whitespace is crucial. The more spaces something has around it, the more important it will seem.
